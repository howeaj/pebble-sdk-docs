The easiest way to start building a Pebble watchface or app is with [CloudPebble](https://cloudpebble.repebble.com) - no installation required. It runs entirely in your browser!

Otherwise, if you are somewhat command-line knowledgeable, you can follow the instructions below to install the SDK locally on your computer.

## Install dependencies

#### MacOS

You will need to install Node.js. The easiest way is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install node
```

#### Ubuntu

You will need to install a few dependencies to make the SDK run:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm libsdl1.2debian libfdt1 libsdl2-2.0-0 libpixman-1-0
```

> Note: if you already have `node` installed, you can install only:

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl1.2debian libfdt1 libsdl2-2.0-0 libpixman-1-0
```

#### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install nodejs SDL-devel dtc SDL2 pixman glib2
```

#### Windows

The Pebble SDK does not run on Windows, but you can use WSL.  Install Ubuntu
in WSL, and then use the instructions above to install dependencies.

## Download the Pebble CLI

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), a fast package manager for Python.

Then, run:

```bash
uv tool install pebble-tool --python 3.13
```

> Note: pebble-tool requires Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13 (higher than 3.9 and lower than 3.14).

## Next Steps

Now that you have the Pebble SDK downloaded and installed on your computer,
it is time to create your first app!

#### Create a Pebble app

Install the latest SDK:

```bash
pebble sdk install latest
```

Create a project (for example, called myproject):

```bash
pebble new-project myproject
```

Compile the project (after `cd`ing to your project directory):

```bash
pebble build
```

Install the app on an emulator for the Pebble Time:

```bash
pebble install --emulator basalt
```

Or, install the app/watchface on your phone. 

Requires the new Pebble mobile app (install at [rePebble.com/app](https://repebble.com/app)) -> go to Devices -> tap 3 dots -> Enable Dev Connect -> Sign into GitHub. Then back on your computer, run

```bash
pebble login # Sign into GitHub
pebble install --cloudpebble
```

Or try [tutorials](/tutorials/) for a step-by-step guide on how
to write a simple C Pebble application.

### Installation Problems?

If you have any issues with downloading or installing the Pebble SDK, feel free to post your comments in `#sdk-dev` in the
