Our watchface tells the time with style, but a great watchface also gives
useful information at a glance. In this part we will add two popular features:
a battery meter and a Bluetooth disconnect alert.

By the end of this part, your watchface will look something like this:

{% screenshot_viewer %}
{
  "image": "/images/tutorials/watchface-tutorial/part3.png",
  "default": "emery",
  "platforms": [
    {"hw": "aplite", "wrapper": "steel-black"},
    {"hw": "basalt", "wrapper": "time-red"},
    {"hw": "chalk", "wrapper": "time-round-rosegold-14"},
    {"hw": "diorite", "wrapper": "pebble2-black"},
    {"hw": "emery", "wrapper": "core-time2-red"},
    {"hw": "gabbro", "wrapper": "core-time-round2-black-20"}
  ]
}
{% endscreenshot_viewer %}

This section continues from
[*Part 2*](/tutorials/watchface-tutorial/part2/), so be sure to re-use your
code or start with that finished project.

## The Battery Meter

### Subscribing to Battery Events

The battery level is obtained using the ``BatteryStateService``. Like the
``TickTimerService``, it works by calling a function whenever the battery state
changes.

Start by declaring a variable to store the current charge level at the top of
your file:

```c
static Layer *s_battery_layer;
static int s_battery_level;
```

Create a callback that stores the new level and triggers a redraw:

```c
static void battery_callback(BatteryChargeState state) {
  // Record the new battery level
  s_battery_level = state.charge_percent;

  // Update the meter
  layer_mark_dirty(s_battery_layer);
}
```

``layer_mark_dirty()`` tells the system to redraw the layer at the next
opportunity.

Subscribe to battery events in `init()`:

```c
// Register for battery level updates
battery_state_service_subscribe(battery_callback);

// Ensure battery level is displayed from the start
battery_callback(battery_state_service_peek());
```

``battery_state_service_peek()`` returns the current state immediately, so we
have a value to display right away.


### Drawing the Battery Bar

For the meter we will use a plain ``Layer`` with a ``LayerUpdateProc`` - a
callback that handles all the drawing for that layer. This gives us full
control over how the bar looks.

Our battery bar will have a white rounded-rectangle border and a filled bar
inside that changes color based on the charge level - green when healthy,
yellow when getting low, red when critical:

```c
static void battery_update_proc(Layer *layer, GContext *ctx) {
  GRect bounds = layer_get_bounds(layer);

  // Find the width of the bar (inside the border)
  int bar_width = ((s_battery_level * (bounds.size.w - 4)) / 100);

  // Draw the border
  graphics_context_set_stroke_color(ctx, GColorWhite);
  graphics_draw_round_rect(ctx, bounds, 2);

  // Choose color based on battery level
  GColor bar_color;
  if (s_battery_level <= 20) {
    bar_color = PBL_IF_COLOR_ELSE(GColorRed, GColorWhite);
  } else if (s_battery_level <= 40) {
    bar_color = PBL_IF_COLOR_ELSE(GColorChromeYellow, GColorWhite);
  } else {
    bar_color = PBL_IF_COLOR_ELSE(GColorGreen, GColorWhite);
  }

  // Draw the filled bar inside the border
  graphics_context_set_fill_color(ctx, bar_color);
  graphics_fill_rect(ctx, GRect(2, 2, bar_width, bounds.size.h - 4), 1, GCornerNone);
}
```

> **Note**: ``PBL_IF_COLOR_ELSE()`` lets us use colors on color-capable
> platforms (Basalt, Chalk, Emery) while falling back to white on the
> monochrome Aplite and Diorite.

Create the layer in `main_window_load()` and assign the update proc. We center
it horizontally and place it near the top of the screen:

```c
// Create battery meter Layer - visible bar near the top
int bar_width = bounds.size.w / 2;
int bar_x = (bounds.size.w - bar_width) / 2;
int bar_y = PBL_IF_ROUND_ELSE(bounds.size.h / 8, bounds.size.h / 28);
s_battery_layer = layer_create(GRect(bar_x, bar_y, bar_width, 8));
layer_set_update_proc(s_battery_layer, battery_update_proc);

// Add to Window
layer_add_child(window_get_root_layer(window), s_battery_layer);
```

Clean up in `main_window_unload()`:

```c
layer_destroy(s_battery_layer);
```


## Bluetooth Disconnect Alert

### Subscribing to Connection Events

The ``ConnectionService`` notifies us when the Bluetooth connection changes. We
will show an icon when disconnected and vibrate to alert the user.

Create a callback:

```c
static void bluetooth_callback(bool connected) {
  // Show icon if disconnected
  layer_set_hidden(bitmap_layer_get_layer(s_bt_icon_layer), connected);

  if (!connected) {
    // Issue a vibrating alert
    vibes_double_pulse();
  }
}
```

When `connected` is `true`, the icon is hidden. When `false`, it is shown and
the watch vibrates with a double pulse.

Subscribe in `init()`:

```c
// Register for Bluetooth connection updates
connection_service_subscribe((ConnectionHandlers) {
  .pebble_app_connection_handler = bluetooth_callback
});
```


### Adding the Disconnect Icon

We need a small bitmap image to show when disconnected. Here is the icon we
will use:

<img style="background-color: #CCCCCC;" src="/assets/images/tutorials/intermediate/bt-icon.png"</img>

Save this image to `resources/images/bt-icon.png` in your project.

Add it to the `media` array in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "bitmap",
  "name": "IMAGE_BT_ICON",
  "file": "images/bt-icon.png"
}
```

Declare the ``GBitmap`` and ``BitmapLayer`` at the top of your file:

```c
static BitmapLayer *s_bt_icon_layer;
static GBitmap *s_bt_icon_bitmap;
```

Create both in `main_window_load()`:

```c
// Create the Bluetooth icon GBitmap
s_bt_icon_bitmap = gbitmap_create_with_resource(RESOURCE_ID_IMAGE_BT_ICON);

// Create the BitmapLayer to display the GBitmap - below the battery bar, centered
int bt_y = bar_y + 12;
s_bt_icon_layer = bitmap_layer_create(GRect((bounds.size.w - 30) / 2, bt_y, 30, 30));
bitmap_layer_set_bitmap(s_bt_icon_layer, s_bt_icon_bitmap);
bitmap_layer_set_compositing_mode(s_bt_icon_layer, GCompOpSet);

// Add to Window
layer_add_child(window_get_root_layer(window), bitmap_layer_get_layer(s_bt_icon_layer));
```

Show the correct initial state at the end of `main_window_load()`:

```c
// Show the correct state of the BT connection from the start
bluetooth_callback(connection_service_peek_pebble_app_connection());
```

Clean up in `main_window_unload()`:

```c
gbitmap_destroy(s_bt_icon_bitmap);
bitmap_layer_destroy(s_bt_icon_layer);
```


## Testing in the Emulator

Build and install your watchface as usual:

```text
pebble build && pebble install --emulator emery
```

Once the watchface is running, you can use these commands to test the battery
and Bluetooth features without needing a real watch:

### Setting the Battery Level

Use `pebble emu-set-battery` to change the simulated battery level. Try a few
different values to see the bar color change:

```text
pebble emu-set-battery --percent 80
pebble emu-set-battery --percent 30
pebble emu-set-battery --percent 10
```

You should see the bar go from green to yellow to red as the level decreases.

### Toggling Bluetooth

Use `pebble emu-bt-connection` to simulate a Bluetooth disconnect and
reconnect:

```text
pebble emu-bt-connection --connected no
pebble emu-bt-connection --connected yes
```

When you disconnect, the Bluetooth icon should appear and the watch
should vibrate. When you reconnect, the icon should disappear.

> **Note**: The emulator might take a few seconds before it realizes the
> connection has been lost. This is normal. Just wait a moment and the icon
> will appear.


## Conclusion

In this part we learned how to:

1. Subscribe to the ``BatteryStateService`` for charge level updates.
2. Draw custom graphics using a ``Layer`` with a ``LayerUpdateProc``.
3. Use color-coded battery levels with ``PBL_IF_COLOR_ELSE()``.
4. Subscribe to the ``ConnectionService`` for Bluetooth events.
5. Show/hide layers and trigger vibration alerts.
6. Test battery and Bluetooth features using the emulator.

Your watchface now shows the battery level and alerts you when the phone
disconnects. Check your code against
[the source for this part](https://github.com/coredevices/c-watchface-tutorial/tree/main/part3).


## What's Next?

In the next part we will add weather information by fetching data from the
Open-Meteo API - our first foray into phone-watch communication.
