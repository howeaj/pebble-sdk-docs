Pebble's Timeline Quick View can appear at the bottom of the screen to show
upcoming events. When it does, it covers part of your watchface. In this part
we will use the ``UnobstructedArea`` API to gracefully adapt our layout -
repositioning the time, date, and weather to fit in the remaining space.

Here is what the transition looks like:

{% screenshot_viewer %}
{
  "image": "/images/tutorials/watchface-tutorial/part5.gif",
  "default": "emery",
  "platforms": [
    {"hw": "basalt", "wrapper": "time-red"},
    {"hw": "diorite", "wrapper": "pebble2-black"},
    {"hw": "emery", "wrapper": "core-time2-red"}
  ]
}
{% endscreenshot_viewer %}

This section continues from
[*Part 4*](/tutorials/watchface-tutorial/part4/), so be sure to re-use your
code or start with that finished project.


## How Timeline Quick View Works

Timeline Quick View is a system overlay that obstructs the bottom ~51 pixels of
the screen (including a 2px border). Your watchface is not required to handle
this, but with the ``UnobstructedArea`` API you can detect the change and
rearrange your layers for a better experience.

> **Note**: Timeline Quick View is not currently supported for the Round platforms
> (chalk and gabbro), but writing compatible code ensures your watchface handles it
> gracefully on all platforms.


## Getting Unobstructed Bounds

Prior to SDK 4.0, you would use ``layer_get_bounds()`` to get the full screen
size. The ``UnobstructedArea`` API adds
``layer_get_unobstructed_bounds()``, which returns only the area not covered by
a system overlay:

```c
GRect full_bounds = layer_get_bounds(s_window_layer);
GRect unobstructed_bounds = layer_get_unobstructed_bounds(s_window_layer);
```

If there is no overlay, both return the same rectangle.


## Keeping a Reference to the Window Layer

We need access to the root layer in our handler function, so store it in a
file-level variable:

```c
static Layer *s_window_layer;
```

Set it at the start of `main_window_load()`:

```c
s_window_layer = window_get_root_layer(window);
GRect bounds = layer_get_bounds(s_window_layer);
```


## Subscribing to Unobstructed Area Events

The API provides three event handlers:

- `.will_change` - fires before the obstruction appears or disappears
- `.change` - fires repeatedly during the animation
- `.did_change` - fires after the animation completes

We will use all three to demonstrate the full lifecycle. Subscribe at the end
of `main_window_load()`:

```c
UnobstructedAreaHandlers handlers = {
  .will_change = prv_unobstructed_will_change,
  .change = prv_unobstructed_change,
  .did_change = prv_unobstructed_did_change
};
unobstructed_area_service_subscribe(handlers, NULL);
```

> **Important**: Construct the ``UnobstructedAreaHandlers`` struct before
> passing it to ``unobstructed_area_service_subscribe()``.


## Implementing the Handlers

We use three handlers to split responsibilities cleanly:

### Before the animation - `.will_change`

This fires once before the overlay starts moving. We hide the Bluetooth
disconnect icon during the transition so it does not overlap with repositioning
layers:

```c
static void prv_unobstructed_will_change(GRect final_unobstructed_screen_area,
                                         void *context) {
  // Hide BT icon during the transition to reduce clutter
  layer_set_hidden(bitmap_layer_get_layer(s_bt_icon_layer), true);
}
```

Note the different signature - `.will_change` receives the *final* unobstructed
area as a ``GRect``, so you could use it to prepare for the target layout.

### During the animation - `.change`

This fires repeatedly as the overlay slides in or out. We recalculate all
positions from the current unobstructed bounds so the layers animate smoothly:

```c
static void prv_unobstructed_change(AnimationProgress progress, void *context) {
  GRect bounds = layer_get_unobstructed_bounds(s_window_layer);

  // Reposition time, date, and weather to fit in the available space
  int date_height = 30;
  int block_height = 56 + date_height;
  int time_y = (bounds.size.h / 2) - (block_height / 2) - 10;
  int date_y = time_y + 56;
  int weather_y = bounds.size.h - PBL_IF_ROUND_ELSE(40, 30);

  GRect time_frame = layer_get_frame(text_layer_get_layer(s_time_layer));
  time_frame.origin.y = time_y;
  layer_set_frame(text_layer_get_layer(s_time_layer), time_frame);

  GRect date_frame = layer_get_frame(text_layer_get_layer(s_date_layer));
  date_frame.origin.y = date_y;
  layer_set_frame(text_layer_get_layer(s_date_layer), date_frame);

  GRect weather_frame = layer_get_frame(text_layer_get_layer(s_weather_layer));
  weather_frame.origin.y = weather_y;
  layer_set_frame(text_layer_get_layer(s_weather_layer), weather_frame);
}
```

Since we use the same ``(bounds.size.h / 2) - (block_height / 2) - 10`` formula
as in `main_window_load()`, the time+date block stays centered in the available
space - as the unobstructed bounds shrink, so does the offset, and all layers
naturally slide together.

### After the animation - `.did_change`

This fires once after the overlay finishes moving. If the screen is still
obstructed we keep the Bluetooth icon hidden - there is not enough room for it.
If the screen is back to full size we restore the icon based on the actual
connection state:

```c
static void prv_unobstructed_did_change(void *context) {
  GRect full_bounds = layer_get_bounds(s_window_layer);
  GRect bounds = layer_get_unobstructed_bounds(s_window_layer);
  bool obstructed = !grect_equal(&full_bounds, &bounds);

  // Keep BT icon hidden when obstructed, otherwise restore based on connection
  if (obstructed) {
    layer_set_hidden(bitmap_layer_get_layer(s_bt_icon_layer), true);
  } else {
    layer_set_hidden(bitmap_layer_get_layer(s_bt_icon_layer),
      connection_service_peek_pebble_app_connection());
  }
}
```

Notice that each handler has a different signature - this is a common pattern
in the Pebble SDK.

### Handling Quick View on startup

Timeline Quick View may already be active when the watchface starts. Since the
handlers only fire during transitions, we need to apply the correct layout
immediately. Call the `.change` and `.did_change` handlers manually before
subscribing, replacing the old `bluetooth_callback` call:

```c
// Apply correct layout in case Quick View is already active
prv_unobstructed_change(0, NULL);
prv_unobstructed_did_change(NULL);
```

This repositions the layers and sets the BT icon visibility based on the
current obstruction state, so the watchface looks correct from the first frame.

### How it all fits together

As the overlay slides in, the unobstructed bounds shrink, and all three text
layers slide up together. The Bluetooth icon hides during the transition and
stays hidden while the screen is obstructed. When the overlay goes away,
the icon reappears if the phone is disconnected. Everything stays on screen -
nothing is hidden, just repositioned.


## Testing Timeline Quick View

^CP^ You can toggle Timeline Quick View using the emulator controls in
CloudPebble.

^LC^ You can toggle Timeline Quick View in the emulator:

{% platform local %}
```nc|text
$ pebble emu-set-timeline-quick-view on
$ pebble emu-set-timeline-quick-view off
```
{% endplatform %}

When enabled, you should see the time, date, and weather squeeze together into
the remaining space. The Bluetooth icon hides during the transition and
reappears based on connection state once it finishes. When disabled, everything
returns to its original position.


## Conclusion

In this part we learned how to:

1. Use ``layer_get_unobstructed_bounds()`` to find available screen space.
2. Subscribe to all three ``UnobstructedAreaHandlers`` callbacks.
3. Use `.will_change` to prepare, `.change` to animate, and `.did_change` to
   finalize.
4. Reposition layers dynamically to fit in the unobstructed area.

Your watchface now adapts gracefully to Timeline Quick View. Check your code

## What's Next?

In the next part we will add a settings page with Clay - letting users pick
colors, toggle the date, and choose temperature units.
